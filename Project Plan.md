## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

Establish objectives or goals that the project aims to achieve.

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders

Identify all key stakeholders involved in the project, including internal teams and potential end-users.

### 1.3 Project Scope

Define and manage what is included or excluded in the project and product.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the entire project. WBS should be presented as a hierarchical diagram. Use the elements from the WBS to define activities in Section 3, and schedule these activities in the Gantt Chart in Section 4. Ensure all project activities are considered and included in the WBS.

## 3. Activity Definition Estimation

Define the activities required for your project based on the WBS, and assign responsibilities to team members. Each activity should be numbered and correspond with your Gantt chart. Provide estimated durations for each activity to facilitate Gantt chart preparation.

| Activity #No | Activity Name | Brief Description | Duration | Responsible Team Members |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| xxx          | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx \& yyy               |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | All                      |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx                      |

## 4. Gantt Chart
You have to use the provided Gantt chart template.  

Use the provided Gantt chart template to list all items from the Activity Definition along with relevant estimates 
and scheduling. Ensure that the Gantt chart reflects the activity definitions from Section 3. Track actual start 
times and durations. Besides including Gantt chart here, you should also submit your Gantt chart file separately.
