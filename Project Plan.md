## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

### Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a data analysis and visualization tool for the Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database. The tool will enable users to efficiently search for foods and view detailed nutritional information, visualize nutrient breakdowns, filter foods based on nutritional content ranges and levels and calculate nutritional information based on weight. The goal is to provide a tool with an easily interactable graphical interface for analyzing and understanding nutritional data and display the data through both text and graphics. 

Notes: 

Establish objectives or goals that the project aims to achieve.

* Food search, Nutrition breakdown, Nutrition Range filter and ???
  * selecting multiple foods and displaying the combined nutritional information 
  * having a calculator where you go input the weight of the food in grams and display the nutritional information.
  * Retrieve specific nutritional stats from a food and determine the amount required for a meal/ daily intake
The dataset includes specific features that your user interface must enable a user
  * Easily interactable interface
  * Reduce the number of steps to obtain the required information
  * Data is clearly conveyed through both text and graphs.

The data usable and applicable to the average user's dietry requirements.


### 1.2 Project Stakeholders 

The development of the data analysis and visualisation tool for the Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database involves a range of stakeholders. These stakeholders include internal teams responsible for the design, development, and deployment of the tool, as well as external parties who will influence or use the final product. Each stakeholder group has a specific role in shaping the tool's functionality and ensuring it meets the necessary standards. Below is a list of the key stakeholders, categorised by their roles in the project.

#### Internal Stakeholders

* Management/Client: Responsible for overseeing and approving the project and ensuring alignment with organisational goals.
* Project Managers: Oversee the project's progress, ensuring timelines and budgets are met.
* Programmers: Develop the back-end functionality and ensure the tool works as intended.
* User Interface Designers: Design the graphical user interface to ensure ease of use and accessibility.
* Quality Assurance: Test the tool to ensure it meets all requirements and is free of bugs.
* Cybersecurity Specialists: Ensure the tool is secure and compliant with data protection standards.
* Data Analysts: Analyze the nutritional data to ensure accurate representation and functionality within the tool.
* Database Administrators: Manage and optimise the nutritional database, ensuring its integration with the tool.
* Business Analysts: Gather requirements, perform market analysis, and ensure the tool aligns with user needs and business objectives.

#### External Stakeholders: 

* Government Bodies: May provide guidelines or regulations regarding nutritional data representation and user privacy.
* End Users, which may include: 
  * Sports Professionals;
  * People with dietary requirements or restrictions;
  * Doctors;
  * Nutritionists;
  * Dietitians; and
  * Health-Conscious Consumers.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure (Juan)

Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the entire project. WBS should be presented as a hierarchical diagram. Use the elements from the WBS to define activities in Section 3, and schedule these activities in the Gantt Chart in Section 4. Ensure all project activities are considered and included in the WBS.
1 Initiating:
* Assign roles in project
* Set Objective
* Identify stakeholders
* Define project
2 Project management plan:
* WBS
* Activity definitions
* Gantt Chart
3 Software design:
* Define the system vision
* Set software and user requirements
* Use case diagram and use cases
* Software design
* User hierachy chart
* Design wireframes and mockups
4 Executing:
* Setup program code
* Implement Food search
* Nutrition breakdown
* Nutrition range filter
* Nutrition level filter
* ??? Additional feature
* User interface implementation
* API implementation
5 Testing
* (Unit testing/Functional testing) each of the main features of the application
* (Integration testing) R interacts with the GUI
* (End to end) User experience/use case testing.
* Bug hunting
* (Acceptence testing) Sending to client for approval/ internal testing
* Performance/ optimisation
6 Closing
* Finalising documentation
* Logging hours/time sheets
* Final handover to client
* Performance review and gitlog

## 3. Activity Definition Estimation (Josh)

Define the activities required for your project based on the WBS, and assign responsibilities to team members. Each activity should be numbered and correspond with your Gantt chart. Provide estimated durations for each activity to facilitate Gantt chart preparation.

## 4. Gantt Chart [Ask Kevin]
You have to use the provided Gantt chart template.  

Use the provided Gantt chart template to list all items from the Activity Definition along with relevant estimates 
and scheduling. Ensure that the Gantt chart reflects the activity definitions from Section 3. Track actual start 
times and durations. Besides including Gantt chart here, you should also submit your Gantt chart file separately.
