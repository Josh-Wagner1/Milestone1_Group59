## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

### Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a data analysis and visualization tool for the Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database. The tool will enable users to efficiently search for foods and view detailed nutritional information, visualize nutrient breakdowns, filter foods based on nutritional content ranges and levels and calculate nutritional information based on weight. The goal is to provide a tool with an easily interactable graphical interface for analyzing and understanding nutritional data and display the data through both text and graphics. 

Notes: 

Establish objectives or goals that the project aims to achieve.

* Food search, Nutrition breakdown, Nutrition Range filter and ???
  * selecting multiple foods and displaying the combined nutritional information 
  * having a calculator where you go input the weight of the food in grams and display the nutritional information.
  * Retrieve specific nutritional stats from a food and determine the amount required for a meal/ daily intake
The dataset includes specific features that your user interface must enable a user
  * Easily interactable interface
  * Reduce the number of steps to obtain the required information
  * Data is clearly conveyed through both text and graphs.

The data usable and applicable to the average user's dietry requirements.


### 1.2 Project Stakeholders
