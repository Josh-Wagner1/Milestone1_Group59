## 1. System Vision

### 1.1 Problem Background

- Problem Identification: What problem does this system solve?
- Dataset: What is the dataset used?
- Data Input/Output: What kind of data input and output is required?
- Target Users: Who will use the system, and why?

### 1.2 System capabilities/overview

- System Functionality: What will the system do?
- Features and Functionalities: Describe the key features and functionalities of the system.

### 1.3	Benefit Analysis

How will this system provide value or benefit?

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 User Requirements

Detail how users are expected to interact with or use the program. What functionalities must the system provide from the end-user perspective? This can include both narrative descriptions and a listing of user needs.

Note: Since no specific client or user is assigned, you may create a fictional user. Who do you envision using your software?

### 2.2	Software Requirements
Define the functionality the software will provide. This section should list requirements formally, often using the word "shall" to describe functionalities.

Example Functional Requirements:  
- R1.1 The program shall accept multiple file names as arguments from the command line.  
- R1.2 Each file name can be a simple file name or include the full path of the file with one or more levels.  

- etc …

### 2.3 Use Case Diagram
Provide a system-level Use Case Diagram illustrating all required features.

Example:  
![Use Case Diagram](./UCD.png)

### 2.4 Use Cases
Include at least 5 use cases, each corresponding to a specific function.


| Use Case ID    | xxx  |
|----------------|------|
| Use Case Name  | xxxx |
| Actors         | xxxx |
| Description    | xxxx |
| Flow of Events | xxxx |
| Alternate Flow | xxxx |



## 3.	Software Design and System Components 

### 3.1	Software Design
Include a flowchart that illustrates how your software will operate.

Example:  
![Software Design](./software_design_flowchart.png)

### 3.2	System Components

#### 3.2.1 Functions
List all key functions within the software. For each function, provide:
- Description: Brief explanation of the function’s purpose.
- Input Parameters: List parameters, their data types, and their use.
- Return Value: Describe what the function returns.
- Side Effects: Note any side effects, such as changes to global variables or data passed by reference.

#### 3.2.2 Data Structures / Data Sources
List all data structures or sources used in the software. For each, provide:

- Type: Type of data structure (e.g., list, set, dictionary).
- Usage: Describe where and how it is used.
- Functions: List functions that utilize this structure.

#### 3.2.3 Detailed Design
Provide pseudocode or flowcharts for all functions listed in Section 3.2.1 that operate on data structures. For instance, include pseudocode or a flowchart for a custom searching function.


## 4. User Interface Design

### 4.1 Structural Design
Present a structural design, a hierarchy chart, showing the overall interface’s structure. Address:

- Structure: How will the software be structured?
- Information Grouping: How will information be organized?
- Navigation: How will users navigate through the software?
- Design Choices: Explain why these design choices were made.

Example:  
![Structural Design](./Structural_Design.png)

### 4.2	Visual Design
Include all wireframes or mock-ups of the interface. Provide a discussion, explanation, and justification for your design choices. Hand-drawn wireframes are acceptable.

- Interface Components: Clearly label all components.
- Screens/Menus: Provide wireframes for different screens, menus, and options.
- Design Details: Focus on the layout and size of components; color and graphics are not required.
